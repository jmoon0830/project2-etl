The situation:
You are a data analyst working for a gaming company. Your boss wants to start a new project for a new video game to release.
But he doesnâ€™t know what kind of game to make.You might consider, what genre is popular right now, what streamers are playing
right now, what kind of video games make the most money, etc.

We have gathered 3 different sources of information:

First, gather information from Twitch.tv API to get live data from the top games being player at the moment.

Explaining the files:
The config.py has user information needed to run the python files.
The methods.py containes a function to to a get request of the the top 20 games.
The run.py will output a json response of the top 20 games being played at the time of the function.
The convert.py to convert the json file into a csv.
The read_csv.py  will convert the csv and input into a table on postgres SQL.

Steps:
1. Before doing anything, edit the "config.py" file and add your username and password for postgres SQL.
2. Run "python run.py"
3. Run "python convert.py"
4. Before running the last python file, go into pgAdmin and create a database called "twitch_api"
4. Run "python read_csv.py"
5. Done! You will now have data available to view the top 20 games playing on Twitch.tv.
